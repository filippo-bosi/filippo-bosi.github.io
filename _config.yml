          This project implements mapping and navigation algorithms for a simulated robot waiter in a coffee shop environment.
        description: | 
          Here, Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM) and Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization (AMCL), along with the Robot Operating System (ROS) 
          and Gazebo simulation, are used to solve the tasks. The TurtleBot3 robot, equipped with a laser distance sensor and camera module, is used for validation.
          Mapping involves teleoperation and frontier-based exploration, generating binary occupancy maps in MATLAB. Localization is 
          performed using a particle filter, and navigation includes evaluating ROS2 Nav2 and implementing a PRM planner in MATLAB.

          This was the main project of the course "Robot Task and Motion Planning" at KAIST.
        description: This project was intended to make the students truly understand and appreciate why sampling-based motion planning algorithms
          have become the dominant paradigm in robotics. The students were required to implement several sampling-based algorithms
          and answer a series of questions that tested their understanding of motion planning algorithms.

      description:  The objective of this course is to provide the basic concepts and algorithms required to develop mobile robots that act
       autonomously in complex environments. The main emphasis is put on mobile robot locomotion and kinematics, environment perception, 
       probabilistic map based localization and mapping, and motion planning. The lectures and exercises of this course introduce several 
       types of robots such as wheeled robots, legged robots and drones.
